# Decisions

## S13: Advertising

### Dynamic imports for optional native SDKs
- **Decision:** Use dynamic `import()` with try/catch fallback for native-only packages (AdMob, ATT) instead of static imports
- **Why:** Prevents web bundles from including native modules; allows graceful degradation in Expo Go and dev builds; avoids requiring packages to be installed for TypeScript compilation
- **Trade-off:** Slightly more complex loading pattern, but eliminates platform-specific build failures

### Runtime platform branching over file extensions
- **Decision:** Use `Platform.OS` runtime checks in a single component file instead of `.native.tsx`/`.web.tsx` file pairs
- **Why:** Enables all platform logic to be tested in a single Node.js test environment without React Native testing infrastructure; reduces file count; keeps platform differences visible in one place
- **Trade-off:** Slightly larger component files, but dramatically simpler test setup

### Route-pattern allowlist for ad placement
- **Decision:** Ads require explicit public route pattern match (`/public`, `/browse`, `/discover`); all other routes default to no-ads
- **Why:** Fail-safe approach — new routes don't accidentally show ads; explicit private route deny-list provides defense-in-depth
- **Trade-off:** Must update pattern lists when new public routes are added, but prevents accidental ad exposure on private screens

### Type declarations for uninstalled native modules
- **Decision:** Ship `.d.ts` type declarations for `expo-tracking-transparency` and `react-native-google-mobile-ads` rather than installing the packages
- **Why:** These packages require native build tooling (EAS Build) that isn't needed during development; type declarations enable TypeScript compilation and IDE support without native dependencies
- **Trade-off:** Types could drift from actual module API; mitigated by the packages' stable public APIs

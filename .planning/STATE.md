**Core value:** Families can save and share treasured recipes (like Grandma’s) without losing control over who gets to see them.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation (Identity + Family + Privacy)

## Notes

- Privacy is the product. Treat access control as test-worthy, not “UI-only.”
- Scanning is draft-first: users must be able to fix any extracted field quickly.
- Ads must never pollute family/private flows; public browsing is the only ad surface.
